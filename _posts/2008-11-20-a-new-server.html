I'm moving to a new server at home sometime soon, so if things go screwy, that's why. I dropping the huge 4U rack mounted beast I've <a href="http://wtwf.com/scripts/2007/07/there-go-my-nines.php">posted about before</a>. In its place is going to be a teeny shuttle case with one PCI slot which is really all I need for my security cam capture cards. I'm going through the stages of setting up ubuntu 8 (hardy) on it right now. I got the PC for $120 which I thought was a deal. I ordered a 1TB SATA drive ($100!) to throw in there and it'll just have one drive for now. It has room for another drive, so at some point I might add another 1.5TB or so. If I need it.<br /><br />Installing ubuntu was a doddle, I installed the server version since that has the longest support lifetime. To get it usable I'm listing the packages I installed incase I need to do it again:<br /><br />sudo apt-get update<br />sudo apt-get upgrade<br />sudo apt-get install gcc python-dns binutils-doc autoconf automake1.9 bison flex gcc-doc gcc-multilib gdb libtool make manpages-dev gcc-4.2-doc gcc-4.2-locales gcc-4.2-multilib libgcc1-dbg libgomp1-dbg libmudflap0-4.2-dev libmudflap0-dbg libc6-dev libc-dev<br />apt-get install gcc python-dns binutils-doc autoconf automake1.9 bison flex gcc-doc gcc-multilib gdb libtool make manpages-dev gcc-4.2-doc gcc-4.2-locales gcc-4.2-multilib libgcc1-dbg libgomp1-dbg libmudflap0-4.2-dev libmudflap0-dbg<br />sudo apt-get install mailman<br />sudo apt-get install smokeping curl libauthen-radius-perl libio-socket-ssl-perl libnet-dns-perl libnet-ldap-perl libnet-telnet-perl libsocket6-perl libio-socket-inet6-perl echoping<br />sudo apt-get install apache2 ssh libapache2-mod-python php5 libapache2-mod-perl2 bind9 mailman screen tkdiff xauth mailx screen  cvs python-cheetah python-mysqldb pychecker x11-apps resolvconf libapache2-mod-python-doc python-egenix-mxdatetime python-mysqldb-dbg tclreadline mesa-utils pdksh libbsd-resource-perl xterm<br /><br />spec's are: Celeron 420, 1 GB of DDR2 RAM, <a href="http://us.shuttle.com/kpc/index.htm">Shuttle KPC K45 SFF</a></div>
