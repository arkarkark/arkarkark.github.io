title: I have a Ham radio blog

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

I've not blogged about it here, even though I guess it is of a technical nature, but I've blogged a bit about it on my personal blog. There hasn't been much, but it seems to be growing a lot and I wanted to document it in the hopes that it might help or encourage someone else. That said, I realize what a dry subject it is and I don't want to blog about it too much here in the fear that I might cause someone to unsubscribe!<br /><br />So if you want to read about my Radio Ham Geekery let me know and I'll let you know the URL.<br /><br />The short summary is that I got my Technician license, got a VHF handheld, then got my General license and built a 1W transceiver from a kit and I'm playing with that right now. I've become much more interested in this than I ever imagined I might be.</div>
