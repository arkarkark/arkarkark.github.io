Since I was able to write the Applescript part of [sql_to_playlist](https://blog.wtwf.com/2020/03/itunes.html) in Python3 I was inspired to get rid of my Ruby applescript things and rewrite them in Python. So I present to you in glorious Python3,
new hotness [imdb_movie_ratings_adder](https://gist.github.com/arkarkark/eef9bb9cfedbc6507a8255e543dd5d1e) (old and busted [ruby version](https://gist.github.com/arkarkark/eef9bb9cfedbc6507a8255e543dd5d1e/2cc20b574d0b82201b65df750abebf4ddc185de5)) and
[update_itunes_selection](https://gist.github.com/arkarkark/3ccc9697650c6e97778de128e5a73b30)
([ruby version](https://gist.github.com/arkarkark/3ccc9697650c6e97778de128e5a73b30/1bf73421989965759446aedba3205a1a8fbb2e4a)). I never liked writing Ruby code. If you want to compare

The change was pretty easy and I was able to improve both scripts while I ported them over. They both remained about the same number of lines of code, despite using [black](https://github.com/psf/black) on the new code. The threading was more complicated in Python and I'm sure I can could have done it more concisely had I known more or been better, but at least the new version uses a work queue rather than just firing off threads willy nilly.

I also learned or re-learned some nice little Python things I'm going to mention here so I can find them again. `f"hello {who}"` is a nice way to put variables into strings. `@property` was a neat way to add calculated properties to classes and for general getters and setters. `json.loads(text_data, object_hook=lambda d: types.SimpleNamespace(**d))` made nice objects from json that I could access as properties rather than dict lookups. e.g. `reply.Error` rather than `reply["Error"]`, downside is you have to use `hasattr(reply, "Error")` rather than `"Error" in reply` but I found it better. I also really appreciate
`argparse.ArgumentParser()`. I upped my game a little by writing to other variables using `dest=` like this:

```
    parser.add_argument(
        "--no-open",
        dest="open",
        default=True,
        help="open in a browser",
        action="store_false",
    )
```
