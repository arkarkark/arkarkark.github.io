here is <a href="http://wtwf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/chrome/extensions/fix-style.crx">fix-style.crx</a> tah dah. It makes the article text in Google Reader and Slashdot larger (and readable).&nbsp;Here is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wtwf/source/browse/trunk/chrome/extensions/#extensions/fix-style">the source</a>.<br /><div><br />Since I wrote that I've also ported over some of my other greasemonkey scripts. I still need to polish them up a lot but they're working and that's cool. I'm looking forward to playing with settings pages and auto updates and what not.<br /><br />I also made a Makefile (my first in about 7 years) to make the .crx file automatically using a python program I found on the intertubes (and modified slightly)<br /><br />I'm mostly using the dev channel Chrome on Linux and Mac and they just added extensions support, it's really nice and is now my primary browser.<br /><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
