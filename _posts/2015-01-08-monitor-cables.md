I needed a portrait monitor next to my main screen, I had an old Mac 20" cinema display (1680x1050) but the stand only supported landscape orientation. Enter the leftover bit of some [ESI Silicone bike grips](https://smile.amazon.com/ESI-Racers-Edge-Grip-Green/dp/B003RLH53Y) that I chopped off to accomodate a grip shift shifter and it grips to the table and monitor really well and doesn't slip. Bonus was that I could feed my phone and hard drive cables under the gap and pull them out when I need them. Tidy!
