Every year we send out a sheet of photos and our Christmas letter with our cards. I figure I might as well document it here:

To make the photo montage sheet I use a program called [Comic Life](https://plasq.com/downloads/comic-life-desktop/). It's super easy to use. I make the boxes then drop photos inside them. I can then scale the photos and they never grow outside the box. The paper was a harder problem. Regular photo paper is too thick, hard to fold and sometimes gets my cards sent back with insufficient postage. I found this [lightweight photo paper](https://www.redrivercatalog.com/browse/32lb-premium-matte-double-sided.html) that works well. You can also just make your image and hand it over to someone like shutterfly for them to mail it out which really would make things a lot simpler but doesn't seem very personal to me.

I write the letter part as a group effort with the family, we can each edit and add our own flair to it.

I just use a google sheet for address labels. I add a column so I can sort them in furthest away first so those get sent first. The [avery online label maker](https://app.print.avery.com/) does a good job of mail merge from a csv file.

Finally I make a google drive folder named after the year under "Xmas Cards" where I put all the files for this year. I put both the original files and also the final print pdf files too.
