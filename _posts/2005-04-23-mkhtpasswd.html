<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

I run a website and some mailman lists. I wanted to create some areas that only members of certains lists can get at. I'd like to use mailman's password management to look after users rather than have them look after multiple usernames and passwords. I know mailman keeps passwords in plain text so I dug around in the code and created a script that takes the users/passwords for a list and creates a .htaccess and .htpassword file for them.<br /><br />Just run this with a listname and the directory you want to protect and you're all done!<br /><br />Stay tuned for some fancy redirection error document magic to link people to the right page in mailman for them to find and set their passwords.<br /><br /><br /><b>NOTE: this needs some work, it doesn't update if someone updated their password (doh!)</b></div>
