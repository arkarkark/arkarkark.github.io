I've done a bit of electrical work and no matter how well labeled the electrical panel is, sometimes it's hard to find the right breaker to turn off. Here's my pro tip: I called my wife's iPhone with FaceTime (you can likely call your laptop or something), set the phone looking at the light I wanted to turn off and then went and flipped breakers until the light went out (always double check, you might only be switching your wireless router off!).</div>
