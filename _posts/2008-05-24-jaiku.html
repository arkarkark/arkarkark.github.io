I've been playing around with <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>, Google's purchased <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> clone/competitor. I also played with Twitter at the same time (actually revived an account I made ages ago). Twitter sucks, it's way way too slow to even approach usability so I gave up on it. Jaiku is zippy fast which is likely a function of the number of users of each service, but perhaps one scales better than the other.<br /><br />I've had a need for something that's not quite blogging, but blogging, I try to keep my posts down, so that when they do show up they might be somewhat interesting, But I also have random blabbering, thoughts observations I'd like to note and perhaps aggregate into a post at some point. micro-blogging seemed ideal for this. But I also didn't want a high barrier to entry so Jaiku's IM robot seemed like a good idea. You just IM them a message and it shows up in your jaiku account. Perfect for easy Jaiku-ing. However the robot has an annoying habit of sending you messages about what everyone else is doing. I guess that's the point, but I find it annoying. Especially in gmail where it flashes the title when you have an unread IM, from Jaiku.<br /><br />Grouping together posting and reading in the same IM robot is like making my blogger post page also be my google reader. They should be two separate activities that I can merge if I like.<br /><br />Looks like I'm going to have to learn a Jaiku API and how to write my own jabber robot (in python!). Perhaps I'll host in on Google App Engine (I wonder if you can for things like this?).<br /><br />As an aside, getting the IM set up was a nightmare since my Google Apps domain wasn't exporting SRV DNS records for jabber. The DNS hosting (chosen by Google) was down for editing so I had to deal with their support department (ugh!). Here is the magic command to make sure you have it set up right (replace example.com with your domain name):<pre class="code">dig srv _xmpp-server._tcp.example.com</pre></div>
