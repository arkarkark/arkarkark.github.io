If you've ever been bothered that a site doesn't have a favicon, or has the wrong favicon, then I have the answer for you.<br /><br /><a href="http://wtwf.com/scripts/bin/installfavicon.user.js">installfavicon.user.js</a><br /><br />You can update the map at the top of the file with hostnames you want the favicon to be installed on.<br /><br />I use it to give gmail and a google hosted domain's email different favicons.<br /><br />It also has the ability to set the title of the page if it's all generic and you want a specific one.<br /><br />I could build a UI around this, but greasemonkey's excellent 'edit' button kinda makes it too easy for me to just ask you to edit the source.</div>
