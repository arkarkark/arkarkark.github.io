I love my <a href="http://kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm">Kinesis keyboards</a>, They're wicked expensive but just recently I've learned you get great service with the high price. Also let it be known I've never actually paid for a keyboard (about $300 now), I've always expensed them. The increase in productivity and comfort is well worth the cost (to my employer!). About a month ago my 'i' key got really flaky and one email and they sent me a whole new key-well (a whole half a keyboard) I had to move over the key caps but still I was very impressed. Well a fizzy water incident caused my 'f' key to stop working and they're sending me the other side now (all free of charge). They even made it sound like I was doing them a favor because I was willing to swap out the key wells myself. I guess when you charge that much for a keyboard you can afford to back it up with great service.<br /><br />I tell you, not having an f key is ucking rustrating.</div>

Gotta agree with liking the Kinesis keyboard. I've been using one for about 4 years now and I can't imagine life without it.<BR/><BR/>I remember expensing one at my current company. They were in a tizzy because they couldn't see how one can pay $300 for a keyboard.<BR/><BR/>I remember that it was a difficult transition from a standard keyboard and I would practice typing exercises with the Kinesis for about a 1/2 hour a night 4 times a week for about a month. There were a couple of false starts by switching cold turkey at work but I revered to my old MS Natural to be productive.<BR/><BR/>It's a great keyboard!</div>
