I've posted before about my little script to make atom feeds more private by expiring old posts by replacing the text, <a href="http://wtwf.com/scripts/2008/04/feedfixer.php">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.wtwf.com/2007/08/my-feed-is-private-kthxbye.php">here</a>. I've also posted about <a href="http://blog.wtwf.com/2008/04/password-protecting-your-site.php">weak password protecting your sites</a>. This was all that I did to have a blog that was private from the search engines but easy for people to read either in google reader or via email or in their browser. I did this using blogger.com's sftp support (I also ran a <a href="http://blog.wtwf.com/2009/12/sftp-in-chroot-environment.php">chrooted sftp server</a>). Seems that my paranoia has fueled quite a few posts here in the past, eh! Well Blogger has decided to stop supporting sftp publishing so I've had t find another solution. Unlucky for me, I like the blogger posting UI and I think I found a good solution that will allow me to keep my content out of search engines and still make it accessible to folks that I want to read it. I'm not talking about this blog by the way, I'm talking about my daughter's blog and my personal blog. I'm going to have a blog that is invite only, you need to be specifically invited to read it, otherwise you end up at a rather unhelpful 'you need access' page with no way to contact me to ask for access. To make my blog readable in google reader all I needed to do was get the feed and make it available. I thought of a few ways to do this. First plan was to subscribe to the blog and then get some kind of email to rss gateway worked out. I wish mailman supported this but it doesn't. I did manage to get a patch to do it, but never worked on it because by the time I got the patch I also found my final solution. I wrote a Google AppEngine app that stored oauth credentials and fetched the feed from blogger, trimmed it and published it for all to see. I used code from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/source/browse/#svn/trunk/samples/blogger/oauth-appengine">gdata python blogger oauth example</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/salmon-protocol/source/browse/trunk/salmon-playground/bloggerproxy.py">salmon protocol</a>&nbsp;and ended up with my own 'Feed App' (Say it with a <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/beachedaz">New Zealand accent</a>) check out the source code at:<br /><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/wtwf/source/browse/#svn/trunk/feeds/feedappwtwf">http://code.google.com/p/wtwf/source/browse/#svn/trunk/feeds/feedappwtwf</a><br /><br />I plan to extend it to implement the expandRss functionality in a server that should be more reliable than my home network connection but for now it does the job and that makes me happy. I encountered a few problems while writing it. The oauth code required you to be logged in, but I wanted some of the urls to work without being logged in. I finally tracked it down and used&nbsp;users.create_login_url('/oauth/request_token') to make sure the user was logged in. The oauth.py code failed silently when the user wasn't logged in (very annoying!). I also found out that when you get the feed via oauth you end up getting all the draft blog posts too! so I had to write in a quick check to filter those out. I guess I really should make a google account that can only read the blogs then that might only get a feed with the real blog posts in it.<br /><br />Now I'm off to work out how to point all my old blog posts at the new blog that's living in a subdomain and to play with the new fancy blogger templates, whee!</div>
