My daughter's [Flite Test Storch](https://www.flitetest.com/articles/ft-simple-storch-build) has been through quite a lot so we were looking for a new plane for her to build and fly. She wanted something slow and stable, so we built a [Flite Test Simple Soarer](https://www.flitetest.com/articles/ft-simple-soarer-build).

I cut up all the foamboard in advance and we were able to put it together in a couple of hours. Unfortunately the lack of ailerons made it super boring and hard to fly so we weren't very thrilled with it at all.
