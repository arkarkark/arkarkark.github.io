I just switched over to using emacs from brew rather than&nbsp;emacsformacosx.com<br />I really wanted 24.4 to fix the annoying distnoted runaway process bug.<br /><br />It was as easy as:<br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">brew install emacs --HEAD --use-git-head --cocoa --with-gnutls --with-rsvg --with-imagemagick</span><br /><br />I wanted to note that to run the GUI app I ran:<br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">open /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/HEAD/Emacs.app</span><br /><br />Then I selected keep in dock from the icon. I have no idea how bad it is to run it out of Cellar but it's working. Let me know if I'm doing something wrong.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
