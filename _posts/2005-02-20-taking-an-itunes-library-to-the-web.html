I've done some work on putting my itunes library on the web I intend to document some of it here.<br /><br />It started out with a perl script to generate HTML from the library XML. Thhe HTML is limited to just playlists.<br /><br />I'll be working on putting it into a MySQL database so I can generate more interesting things from it.<br /><br />I just found this <a href="http://www.djml.com/software.djml">http://www.djml.com/software.djml</a> it claims to take my iTunes and put them into MySQL! awesome.<a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/get/HTML-Tools/phptunest.shtml"></a></div>
