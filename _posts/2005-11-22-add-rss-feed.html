You've probably noticed the really crappy looking collection of little buttons on the side of my blogs. I guess I really shouldn't care, and I guess I should just be pimping the method <span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span> prefer to read my blogs with (<a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> of course!). But since I was doing it I thought I should do it properly. All those buttons are on all my blogs and they all the same PHP file included, on my template (more on PHP and blogger templates in another post...). The PHP works out where the feed is (or you can tell it) and then makes all the buttons.<br /><br />Here's the php as a text file in case you'll find it useful on your site. I forgot whose original site I used to get the format for most of these links.<br /><br /><a href="/scripts/2005/addfeed.txt">addfeed.php</a></div>
