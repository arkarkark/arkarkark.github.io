title: getting google buzz on your desktop

If you haven't yet got Google Buzz in your gmail, or like me you're using Google Apps For Your Domain (GAFYD) and you won't get it for a month or so there is a cunning trick you can use to get it on your desktop right now.<br /><br />All you need to do is pretend to be a mobile phone, phones going to buzz.google.com see the phone version of the UI and it's serviceable for posting updates and managing friends. There's so much missing but it's a good start. Google Chrome accepts a --user-agent flag and the user agent for the Google Nexus One phone is&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.1-update1; en-us; Nexus One). </span>That's easy to add under Windows or Linux, on the Mac it's a little harder but the&nbsp;<a href="http://dev.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory">User Data Directory</a>&nbsp;page gives you instructions on how to set up a different user-data-dir which is also a good idea. Here's the string I used.<br /><br /><pre class="code">do shell script "/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --enable-udd-profiles --user-data-dir=/Users/$USER/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Buzz --user-agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.1-update1; en-us; (Nexus One)'  &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;"<br /></pre><pre class="code"></pre><pre class="code"></pre>One day I'll work out a nice way to get the Buzz Icon in there, likely I'll spend days on it and finish the day before I get full featured buzz in my GAFYD mailbox!<br /><br />If you'd like to pretend to be an iPad the useragent is "Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.4 Mobile/7B334b Safari/531.21.10" I wonder if it's a coincidence this is 141 characters and untweetable?<br /><pre class="code"></pre><pre class="code"></pre></div>
