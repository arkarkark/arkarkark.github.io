title: The Best Headlamp ever

This is the best headlamp ever. Great for hiking and camping and even just working around the house. Here are the reasons why

 * It's bright
 * It's very light
 * It only uses one AA battery so carrying spare batteries is easy.
 * After it's been on for a few seconds pressing the button ONCE turns it off
 * It turns on at full power
 * It has a hinge to change the angle (unlike the [Petzl Zipka](https://www.rei.com/product/162601/petzl-zipka-headlamp))
 * It has a red/night mode which is perfect for finding things in your tent at night.
 * It's cheap.

I've found this lamp in several places at several price points. Before I found it I also tried quite a few others like this [Fenix HL16](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DBD5MF) which is o.k. but not nearly as good. This [headlamp](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33049523460.html) looks similar but is nothing near as good.

My first version of this headlamp was a Rayvenge T1A whose amazon page has vanished. Here's some [flashlight nerds](https://budgetlightforum.com/node/44204) who seem to like it and have ideas on how to improve it.
I did try this [SmarterLife](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V2LZ6Z0) light but it didn't work out of the box so I returned it. I found the same light on ebay as a [Lixada J4M9](https://www.ebay.com/itm/353663432507) This one works great, but I can't find it anymore.

One time I dropped the light and the little plastic pin that makes up the hinge broke. I was bummed. I had a working light but no way to point it anywhere. I took half an old gopro extention mount and filed a V in it and expoxied the light into that and it now works great as a little bike light on my gopro helmet mount.
