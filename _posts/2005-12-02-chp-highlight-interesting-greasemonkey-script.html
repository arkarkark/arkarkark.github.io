If you drive around California you'll find the <a href="http://cad.chp.ca.gov/">CHP website</a> very very useful. You can see all the CHP dispatches and see where the problems are. The custom region option is really nice to pare down the reports to areas you actually drive.<br /><br />I made a small <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">greasemonkey</a> script to take that to the next level and make the roads or events your interested in highlight and move to the top of the list. Just enter the road names, or keywords you want in the top of the script and tah dah, you're golden.<br /><br /><a href="/scripts/2005/chphighlight.user.js">chphighlight.user.js</a><br /><br />If I was feeling really fancy I would have allowed you to edit the wods in a UI (like Mihai's gmail saved searches does) but I'm really not in the mood for that right now. Perhaps version 2?</div>
