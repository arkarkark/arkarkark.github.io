<escaped feed="" url="">I'm pretty sure you know that if anyone reads your feeds in google reader then a feed of every single post that you've ever made is available from Google Reader. This is a great resource. I'm a firm believer that a lot of my social content should be ephemeral and only last a few weeks before it is obliterated from the corpus. That's why I wrote <a href="http://wtwf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/feeds/feedfixer.py">feedfixer.py</a>&nbsp;which marks feeds as private and also replaces old posts with tombstones. In a tombstone post the subject and body of the feed item is blanked out, Google dutifully replaces the contact with this blank content and thus the original content is erased. My <a href="http://docs.wtwf.com/feed-app">Feed-App</a> also tombstones posts from old private blogger feeds and feeds created by forwarding email to it. </escaped><br /><br />This tombstone idea is great for deleting posts and especially useful for those cases where you publish an item and then immediately delete it in blogger. I think the delete post button in blogger should have a big huge warning that you're only deleting it from your site and that a copy of this post likely lives in many feed aggregators, especially Google Reader. Alternatively the delete button in blogger should also make a tombstone for the post in the feed. But it doesn't, so oftentimes you post a post, delete it and then end up seeing the post in your rss reader anyway because the moment you posted, something pinged something else (perhaps via <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">pubsubhubbub</a>) and bam your content was fetched via rss/atom.<br /><br />O.K. that was a long winded statement of the problem, hopefully it had enough keywords to catch the searchers out there. Here's how you delete a post from Google Reader, first the theory, then the tool to make it easier.<br /><br />You can get a feed directly from Google Reader with a URL like this. Just URL escape the feed location and add it to the end.<br />http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/feed/http%3A//googleblog.blogspot.com/atom.xml<br /><br />Inside that feed is an element like this:<br /><img border="0" height="20" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f8j-CtNKUCg/ThQ1mScmREI/AAAAAAAAaEs/KkgYpHYpwd8/s320/Emacs-1.png" width="320" /><br /><br />can page further back by taking the gr:continuation value in the<br /><br />response and adding it as a ?c= query parameter.<br /><br />http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/feed/http%3A//googleblog.blogspot.com/atom.xml?c=&nbsp;CZZZZq83akC<br /><br /><a href="http://downloadfeed.pyhttp//wtwf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/feeds/downloadfeed.py">downloadfeed.py</a><br /><br />is a program that will fetch ALL the feeds just give it a feed URL<br /><br />if you're looking to obliterate a secret from your blog....<br /><br />(fgrep -l secret *.[0-9][0-9][0-9].xml | while read fil; do xmllint -format $fil | egrep 'original-id|secret' ; done) | less<br /><br />then make a new feed with those guids and an empty (I use a single space) subject/body/link<br /><br />tah dah.</div>
