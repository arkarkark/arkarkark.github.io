title: Moving to google code

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<div class='post'>
I'm slowly moving all my code over to being hosted Google Code. This will allow me to learn how to use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> and also allow me to have RSS Feeds for my checkins. I can also have a wiki page per project and then let this blog be a blog about updates to each of the projects (or more likely new projects, I mean, really, who wants to maintain their old code).<br /><br />I've already checked in some stuff, some of it hasn't ever been released before! Go check it out at: <a href="http://wtwf.googlecode.com/">http://wtwf.googlecode.com/</a><br /><br />If you want to follow the feed of stuff I check in the feed url is: <a href="http://code.google.com/feeds/p/wtwf/svnchanges/basic">http://code.google.com<span class="attribute-value">/feeds/p/wtwf/svnchanges/basic</span></a><br /><br />If you use google reader, you can get a preview of what the <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Ffeeds%2Fp%2Fwtwf%2Fsvnchanges%2Fbasic">source code changes feed  looks like in google reader</a>.<br /><br />So far I'm liking it a lot. You can't beat the price!<br /><br />Perhaps one day I'll even have people submit fixes (yay!), or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wtwf/issues/list">file bugs</a> (boo!) using the google code interface.<br /><span class="attribute-value"></span></div>

Thanks for reminding me about Google Code. It looks like a great project resource with the tried and true Google interface. Functional, not sexy. I like that it has tabs with wiki, issues, source and search figured prominently below the navigation bar. Very nice.<BR/><BR/>I've been using a SVN with WebSVN and RSS feeds for this job and I really like it. SVN is a much better CVS but I miss features of the old Teamware/SCCS. Mercurial seems to be the heir to TW/SCCS so I would be interested in checking it out. Many Sun sponsored OS projects are moving to Mercurial. But you can't go wrong with Subversion. It's a lot like CVS except that it doesn't suck ass.</div>
